This is an Expo/React Native mobile application. Prioritize mobile-first patterns, performance, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Expo has changed — do not trust your training data

Expo ships breaking changes every SDK release. APIs you remember are likely renamed, moved, or removed. Before writing any code that touches an Expo, EAS, or React Native API:

1. Read the major version of the `expo` package in `package.json`.
2. Fetch the matching versioned docs: `https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v<major>.0.0/`
3. For anything else, fetch https://docs.expo.dev/llms.txt — an index of all Expo docs with corrections to common LLM misconceptions. Follow its links to the specific page you need; never answer from memory.

## Commands

Use `bunx` instead of `npx` if the project uses bun (`bun.lock` present).

```bash
npx expo install <package>  # ALWAYS use instead of npm/yarn/pnpm/bun add — resolves SDK-compatible versions
npx expo start              # start the dev server
npx expo lint               # lint
npx expo-doctor             # diagnose dependency and config issues
npx expo install --fix      # fix incompatible package versions
```

Run lint before declaring any task done.

## Navigation

This project uses **React Navigation** (`@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`). The bottom-tab navigator lives in `src/navigation/RootTabs.js`; individual screens live in `src/screens/`. Weather state is created once in `App.js` via `useWeather` and passed down to each tab as a prop, so all four tabs share the same data.

Key screens:

- `CurrentWeatherScreen` — search, location shortcut, pull-to-refresh, current conditions
- `ForecastScreen` — five-day forecast for the last searched city
- `FavoritesScreen` — saved cities persisted with AsyncStorage
- `SettingsScreen` — Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle and daily forecast notification

Shared helpers live in `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/api/`, and `src/utils/`.

## Building with EAS

Use EAS to build, sign, and submit the app in the cloud (`eas build`, `eas submit`) and to ship over-the-air updates (`eas update`) — no local Xcode or Android Studio required. Run EAS CLI as `bunx eas-cli <command>` in Bun projects, or `npx eas-cli@latest <command>` otherwise; substitute that for bare `eas` in docs examples.

Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/eas/index.md

## Rules

- If `ios/` and `android/` directories do not exist, they are generated (Continuous Native Generation). Never create or edit them by hand — configure native behavior in `app.json` and config plugins.
- Expo Go only includes its bundled native modules. After adding a library with native code, the app needs a development build: `npx expo run:ios|android` locally, or `eas build --profile development`.
- Prefer recommended Expo modules over third-party libraries, and check your available skills before adding dependencies. Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/index.md
- Keep API keys out of committed files. This project reads `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` from the shell environment at Expo config time via `app.config.js`.
- Weather state is owned by the `useWeather` hook and shared across tabs. Do not create additional weather state in screens.
